There is no real way to guage their general location, but age wise my client believes his audience is anywhere between 18 to 35. There is potential that younger viewers might tune in. The stream does not focus on trending video games, so much as it focuses on smaller indie titles, and classics. For this reason, those who intend to view will be part of smaller, more niche communities.
