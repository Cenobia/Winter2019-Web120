 <p>My name is Jordan Samson, and I was born and raised in Fort Collins, Colorado. I moved to Seattle back in 2015, because I wanted a change of pace. I am currently engaged, and attending SCC with intent to earn my certificate in web design, and eventually transfer into a BAS program. Currently, I have my eyes set on Lake Washington Techincal College. I am going to be focused on front-end development, and UI/UX. Back-end is not my forte, and I have a big focus on design. Originally, I wanted to go into graphic design, and instead, I've decided to go into web design as a means to use my artistic background.</p>
 <p>My biggest hobby would have to be video games. I use them in the same way that others read books. I love having a different world to escape to. there are goals, and all sorts of messages that can be conveyed through gaming. I believe that games are an art, an outlet, and a means to experience stories that could not be told in any other medium. </p>

 <h3>Design preference</h3>
 <img src="images/me3.jpg" class="tablet" alt="Picture of of Jordan Samson" />
 <p>In a standard design, I prefer geometric patterns. I also love using contrast to create emphasis. I believe in clean, organized and visually striking designs. <b>P.S. The placeholder image is for the contact me form.</b></p>
