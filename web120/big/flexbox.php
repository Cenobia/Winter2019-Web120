    <h2 class="pageID">FlexBox Research</h2>

    <p>Flexbox is an interesting way to format parts of pages, and I think the uses look interesting. When I did research, I read through the CSS tricks guide, it almost looks as if you can manage all of the content on a page using flexbox. Through the use of div tags, and proper usage in CSS, flexbox looks incredibly useful.</p>

    <p>One thing I did not realize is how many different means there are to format the flex container, and the items within it. There are a lot of ways to control the way the rows work, and the ways that the they display, from flex-flow to justify-content. My base thoughts are that flexbox does look really useful, but it looks like more an advanced CSS trick. Until I try it myself, I do not think im at the level of being able to use it proficiently. Additionally, until flexbox receives full browser support for Internet Explorer, I do not think I would be using it as often. In a sense, I still consider Edge and Internet explorer along the same vein. My current goal is to focus more on user experience and user interface. For that purpose, I want to focus on what everyone is able to see, even a select few who cannot see content will be negatively affected.</p>

    <p>I do think use of flexbox is going to be important in the future, and could become a standard. It looks like an incredibly efficient way to organize content in a grid format, and I want to experiment with it more. I think I will spend next quarter developing test pages using flexbox.</p>
