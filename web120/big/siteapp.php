    <h2 class="pageID">Responsive Vs. Mobile Design Research</h2>

    <p>As technology continues to advance, so do the means at which we develop the means to use it. One of the largest revolutions is the use of smartphones. The amount of people who use smartphones over desktop computers keep increasing, because smartphones are essentially computers on their own. The challenge with this now, is that there are users who will forego having a computer altogether, because the convenience of a smartphone is nearly impossible to match. As a result of this change in how we as a society approach computers and phones, we have developed a means to work with both simultaneously.</p>

    <p>Responsive design changes based on screen size, and is dictated by the CSS on a webpage. Use of @media queries had made it possible to make websites work and flow nicely for both smartphones and computers. Learning to use CSS efficiently to optimize the flow as devices change is imperative to a web developer now. It all boils down to accessibility, and I believe this is the most important concept to learn and understand. As I read Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug, I came to understand that when someone decides to view your webpage, you have milliseconds to impress them, and keep them on your site. This goes for both smartphones and desktop computers. If a person goes to a website that is not mobile responsive, they are likely to leave, due to the frustration of having to navigate in a desktop view.</p>

    <p>Another means of accessibility for mobile users is through the use of mobile apps. An article from thinkmobiles.com outlines the pros and cons of responsive mobile designs versus mobile apps. The primary difference between the two options is cost. A website costs money to make, and in the same vein, so does a mobile app. This results in a business needing to make a decision. Do I ask a developer to make me a mobile application, or a website? In that sense, I think that a website with responsive features is a lot more cost efficient. Websites are also cheaper to develop overall. The article also mentions that people are more likely to visit a website first, rather than downloading an unknown app. That is a point that I do agree with. App development is a huge concept right now, and there are a lot of poorly coded and maintained apps on their download platforms. Personally, I really only use applications by publishers I know, or that already have a large following. Another point to use mobile responsive designs comes from compulse.com, and is bolstered by thinkmobiles.com. Mobile applications are a lot harder to maintain and change, compared to a website. It takes very little effort to make changes across a website, once it has completed development.</p>

    <p>Now, while it seems like mobile apps could have no place, they have a lot of use. Mobile apps are great for storing user data, and catering the experience to the individual. A website needs to be designed for everyone. It needs to have accessibility in mind throughout the whole development process. Will my users understand this? Will they know where to go? Can all ages figure out what they are doing on my webpage? When you have to cater to everyone, a design will change. A mobile app does not need this design process. Take for example a workout application, that tracks progress or sets up workout routines. That will be downloaded and used by people who want to work out. This streamlines the audience, make the design focused. A focused design will feel more personal, and like thinkmobile.com mentions in its table, a mobile app is great for a regular visitor.</p>

    <p>Both mobile responsive designs and mobile apps have their place, and in tandem form a powerful experience for their respective users. Accessibility is important for both, but I think accessibility holds a lot more importance in web design.</p>
