    <p>Ecommerce seems like an incredibly complex process; however, it does seem like there are a bunch of resources to help people looking to set one up. Finances Online has a list of the best rated and most popular ecommerce platforms. From what I have seen from reading up on it, is that the best software really depends on what the client is looking for. Do they want something that allows more HTML and CSS to work well with it, or do that want something with more focus on WordPress? This seems like stuff that is determined by the client, and the web developer is contacted after these decisions.</p>

    <p>In general, monetizing a website seems to be really focused on advertising or providing some type of service. Amazon provides the chance for others to advertise their products for profit. Additionally, there are services that pay out based on the amount of clicks on a banner. There seem to be a lot of methods to monetize a website, but the majority seem to fall into the same vein. Understanding this, I can understand why the use of ad blocking plugins and extensions can cause worry to major companies. I frequently get asked to whitelist a site by websites with a large following. </p>

    <p>Developing a ecommerce website sounds very difficult. The step by step process looks daunting, but I think that is because there is so much going just to get it going. </p>
