    <h2 class="pageID">Galleries Research</h2>

    <p>Through viewing various types of galleries, I have come to the conclusion good galleries stick to a theme. Good galleries had the same spacing around each image and maintained a sense of unity. By unity, I mean that they had the same shapes or general idea. The gallery that had guitar pick-like pieces had every image follow that same shape scheme. A sense of familiarity and calm is gained when a design follows the same principles throughout the whole thing. This applies to a whole website and also individual pages. Another unifying aspect was color. Colors on good galleries complemented one another, allowing for a visually pleasing experience. Color theory makes a large difference when used properly. Not only do colors convey feelings, they also convey importance, or tie everything together.</p>

    <p>As part of the negative examples, I noticed the galleries largely did the opposite of what a good gallery does. Images did not match in terms of scale or spacing. The colors did not tie the page together, rather they pulled everything apart due to a lack of thought and application. They also had completely different shapes in terms of look. Everything about a bad gallery became a detriment to the page. It becomes stressful to look at, and hard to navigate.</p>

    <p>Galleries are important because they are a part of accessibility. Cumbersome galleries can detract from the page, causing the user to leave the page. Certainly, use of words, rather than images can alleviate this. If you are looking for a guitar, why not use have word that says “guitars,” as the button? While yes, that provides a simple solution, and image is much more visually appealing and has a much stronger impact on the user. We design to make things usable and visually pleasing. That is why good practices for galleries is important.</p>
